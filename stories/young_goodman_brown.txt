<div id="story"><h1>YOUNG GOODMAN BROWN</h1><h3>By Nathaniel Hawthorne</h3><p>Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salemvillage; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, toexchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife wasaptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting thewind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to GoodmanBrown.</p><p>"Dearest heart," whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lipswere close to his ear, "prithee put off your journey until sunrise andsleep in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is troubled with suchdreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes. Praytarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year."</p><p>"My love and my Faith," replied young Goodman Brown, "of all nights inthe year, this one night must I tarry away from thee. My journey, asthou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be done 'twixt nowand sunrise. What, my sweet, pretty wife, dost thou doubt me already,and we but three months married?"</p><p>"Then God bless you!" said Faith, with the pink ribbons; "and may youfind all well when you come back."</p><p>"Amen!" cried Goodman Brown. "Say thy prayers, dear Faith, and go tobed at dusk, and no harm will come to thee."</p><p>So they parted; and the young man pursued his way until, being about toturn the corner by the meeting-house, he looked back and saw the headof Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air, in spite of herpink ribbons.</p><p>"Poor little Faith!" thought he, for his heart smote him. "What awretch am I to leave her on such an errand! She talks of dreams, too.Methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face, as if a dream hadwarned her what work is to be done tonight. But no, no; 't would killher to think it. Well, she's a blessed angel on earth; and after thisone night I'll cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven."</p><p>With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himselfjustified in making more haste on his present evil purpose. He hadtaken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest,which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, andclosed immediately behind. It was all as lonely as could be; and thereis this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller knows notwho may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughsoverhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing throughan unseen multitude.</p><p>"There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree," said Goodman Brownto himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, "What ifthe devil himself should be at my very elbow!"</p><p>His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and, lookingforward again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent attire,seated at the foot of an old tree. He arose at Goodman Brown's approachand walked onward side by side with him.</p><p>"You are late, Goodman Brown," said he. "The clock of the Old South wasstriking as I came through Boston, and that is full fifteen minutesagone."</p><p>"Faith kept me back a while," replied the young man, with a tremor inhis voice, caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though notwholly unexpected.</p><p>It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of itwhere these two were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned, thesecond traveller was about fifty years old, apparently in the same rankof life as Goodman Brown, and bearing a considerable resemblance tohim, though perhaps more in expression than features. Still they mighthave been taken for father and son. And yet, though the elder personwas as simply clad as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he hadan indescribable air of one who knew the world, and who would not havefelt abashed at the governor's dinner table or in King William's court,were it possible that his affairs should call him thither. But the onlything about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff,which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wroughtthat it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a livingserpent. This, of course, must have been an ocular deception, assistedby the uncertain light.</p><p>"Come, Goodman Brown," cried his fellow-traveller, "this is a dull pacefor the beginning of a journey. Take my staff, if you are so soonweary."</p><p>"Friend," said the other, exchanging his slow pace for a full stop,"having kept covenant by meeting thee here, it is my purpose now toreturn whence I came. I have scruples touching the matter thou wot'stof."</p><p>"Sayest thou so?" replied he of the serpent, smiling apart. "Let uswalk on, nevertheless, reasoning as we go; and if I convince thee notthou shalt turn back. We are but a little way in the forest yet."</p><p>"Too far! too far!" exclaimed the goodman, unconsciously resuming hiswalk. "My father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor hisfather before him. We have been a race of honest men and goodChristians since the days of the martyrs; and shall I be the first ofthe name of Brown that ever took this path and kept—"</p><p>"Such company, thou wouldst say," observed the elder person,interpreting his pause. "Well said, Goodman Brown! I have been as wellacquainted with your family as with ever a one among the Puritans; andthat's no trifle to say. I helped your grandfather, the constable, whenhe lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through the streets of Salem; andit was I that brought your father a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my ownhearth, to set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip's war. Theywere my good friends, both; and many a pleasant walk have we had alongthis path, and returned merrily after midnight. I would fain be friendswith you for their sake."</p><p>"If it be as thou sayest," replied Goodman Brown, "I marvel they neverspoke of these matters; or, verily, I marvel not, seeing that the leastrumor of the sort would have driven them from New England. We are apeople of prayer, and good works to boot, and abide no such wickedness."</p><p>"Wickedness or not," said the traveller with the twisted staff, "I havea very general acquaintance here in New England. The deacons of many achurch have drunk the communion wine with me; the selectmen of diverstowns make me their chairman; and a majority of the Great and GeneralCourt are firm supporters of my interest. The governor and I, too—Butthese are state secrets."</p><p>"Can this be so?" cried Goodman Brown, with a stare of amazement at hisundisturbed companion. "Howbeit, I have nothing to do with the governorand council; they have their own ways, and are no rule for a simplehusbandman like me. But, were I to go on with thee, how should I meetthe eye of that good old man, our minister, at Salem village? Oh, hisvoice would make me tremble both Sabbath day and lecture day."</p><p>Thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity; but nowburst into a fit of irrepressible mirth, shaking himself so violentlythat his snake-like staff actually seemed to wriggle in sympathy.</p><p>"Ha! ha! ha!" shouted he again and again; then composing himself,"Well, go on, Goodman Brown, go on; but, prithee, don't kill me withlaughing."</p><p>"Well, then, to end the matter at once," said Goodman Brown,considerably nettled, "there is my wife, Faith. It would break her dearlittle heart; and I'd rather break my own."</p><p>"Nay, if that be the case," answered the other, "e'en go thy ways,Goodman Brown. I would not for twenty old women like the one hobblingbefore us that Faith should come to any harm."</p><p>As he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path, inwhom Goodman Brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame, who hadtaught him his catechism in youth, and was still his moral andspiritual adviser, jointly with the minister and Deacon Gookin.</p><p>"A marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the wildernessat nightfall," said he. "But with your leave, friend, I shall take acut through the woods until we have left this Christian woman behind.Being a stranger to you, she might ask whom I was consorting with andwhither I was going."</p><p>"Be it so," said his fellow-traveller. "Betake you to the woods, andlet me keep the path."</p><p>Accordingly the young man turned aside, but took care to watch hiscompanion, who advanced softly along the road until he had come withina staff's length of the old dame. She, meanwhile, was making the bestof her way, with singular speed for so aged a woman, and mumbling someindistinct words—a prayer, doubtless—as she went. The traveller putforth his staff and touched her withered neck with what seemed theserpent's tail.</p><p>"The devil!" screamed the pious old lady.</p><p>"Then Goody Cloyse knows her old friend?" observed the traveller,confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick.</p><p>"Ah, forsooth, and is it your worship indeed?" cried the good dame."Yea, truly is it, and in the very image of my old gossip, GoodmanBrown, the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is. But—would yourworship believe it?—my broomstick hath strangely disappeared, stolen,as I suspect, by that unhanged witch, Goody Cory, and that, too, when Iwas all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf'sbane."</p><p>"Mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe," said theshape of old Goodman Brown.</p><p>"Ah, your worship knows the recipe," cried the old lady, cacklingaloud. "So, as I was saying, being all ready for the meeting, and nohorse to ride on, I made up my mind to foot it; for they tell me thereis a nice young man to be taken into communion to-night. But now yourgood worship will lend me your arm, and we shall be there in atwinkling."</p><p>"That can hardly be," answered her friend. "I may not spare you my arm,Goody Cloyse; but here is my staff, if you will."</p><p>So saying, he threw it down at her feet, where, perhaps, it assumedlife, being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to theEgyptian magi. Of this fact, however, Goodman Brown could not takecognizance. He had cast up his eyes in astonishment, and, looking downagain, beheld neither Goody Cloyse nor the serpentine staff, but hisfellow-traveller alone, who waited for him as calmly as if nothing hadhappened.</p><p>"That old woman taught me my catechism," said the young man; and therewas a world of meaning in this simple comment.</p><p>They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveller exhorted hiscompanion to make good speed and persevere in the path, discoursing soaptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up in the bosom of hisauditor than to be suggested by himself. As they went, he plucked abranch of maple to serve for a walking stick, and began to strip it ofthe twigs and little boughs, which were wet with evening dew. Themoment his fingers touched them they became strangely withered anddried up as with a week's sunshine. Thus the pair proceeded, at a goodfree pace, until suddenly, in a gloomy hollow of the road, GoodmanBrown sat himself down on the stump of a tree and refused to go anyfarther.</p><p>"Friend," said he, stubbornly, "my mind is made up. Not another stepwill I budge on this errand. What if a wretched old woman do choose togo to the devil when I thought she was going to heaven: is that anyreason why I should quit my dear Faith and go after her?"</p><p>"You will think better of this by and by," said his acquaintance,composedly. "Sit here and rest yourself a while; and when you feel likemoving again, there is my staff to help you along."</p><p>Without more words, he threw his companion the maple stick, and was asspeedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening gloom.The young man sat a few moments by the roadside, applauding himselfgreatly, and thinking with how clear a conscience he should meet theminister in his morning walk, nor shrink from the eye of good oldDeacon Gookin. And what calm sleep would be his that very night, whichwas to have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and sweetly now, inthe arms of Faith! Amidst these pleasant and praiseworthy meditations,Goodman Brown heard the tramp of horses along the road, and deemed itadvisable to conceal himself within the verge of the forest, consciousof the guilty purpose that had brought him thither, though now sohappily turned from it.</p><p>On came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders, two grave oldvoices, conversing soberly as they drew near. These mingled soundsappeared to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young man'shiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom at thatparticular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds were visible.Though their figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside, it couldnot be seen that they intercepted, even for a moment, the faint gleamfrom the strip of bright sky athwart which they must have passed.Goodman Brown alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe, pulling asidethe branches and thrusting forth his head as far as he durst withoutdiscerning so much as a shadow. It vexed him the more, because he couldhave sworn, were such a thing possible, that he recognized the voicesof the minister and Deacon Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they werewont to do, when bound to some ordination or ecclesiastical council.While yet within hearing, one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch.</p><p>"Of the two, reverend sir," said the voice like the deacon's, "I hadrather miss an ordination dinner than to-night's meeting. They tell methat some of our community are to be here from Falmouth and beyond, andothers from Connecticut and Rhode Island, besides several of the Indianpowwows, who, after their fashion, know almost as much deviltry as thebest of us. Moreover, there is a goodly young woman to be taken intocommunion."</p><p>"Mighty well, Deacon Gookin!" replied the solemn old tones of theminister. "Spur up, or we shall be late. Nothing can be done, you know,until I get on the ground."</p><p>The hoofs clattered again; and the voices, talking so strangely in theempty air, passed on through the forest, where no church had ever beengathered or solitary Christian prayed. Whither, then, could these holymen be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness? Young GoodmanBrown caught hold of a tree for support, being ready to sink down onthe ground, faint and overburdened with the heavy sickness of hisheart. He looked up to the sky, doubting whether there really was aheaven above him. Yet there was the blue arch, and the starsbrightening in it.</p><p>"With heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against thedevil!" cried Goodman Brown.</p><p>While he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the firmament and hadlifted his hands to pray, a cloud, though no wind was stirring, hurriedacross the zenith and hid the brightening stars. The blue sky was stillvisible, except directly overhead, where this black mass of cloud wassweeping swiftly northward. Aloft in the air, as if from the depths ofthe cloud, came a confused and doubtful sound of voices. Once thelistener fancied that he could distinguish the accents of towns-peopleof his own, men and women, both pious and ungodly, many of whom he hadmet at the communion table, and had seen others rioting at the tavern.The next moment, so indistinct were the sounds, he doubted whether hehad heard aught but the murmur of the old forest, whispering without awind. Then came a stronger swell of those familiar tones, heard dailyin the sunshine at Salem village, but never until now from a cloud ofnight There was one voice of a young woman, uttering lamentations, yetwith an uncertain sorrow, and entreating for some favor, which,perhaps, it would grieve her to obtain; and all the unseen multitude,both saints and sinners, seemed to encourage her onward.</p><p>"Faith!" shouted Goodman Brown, in a voice of agony and desperation;and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying, "Faith! Faith!" as ifbewildered wretches were seeking her all through the wilderness.</p><p>The cry of grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the night, when theunhappy husband held his breath for a response. There was a scream,drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices, fading into far-offlaughter, as the dark cloud swept away, leaving the clear and silentsky above Goodman Brown. But something fluttered lightly down throughthe air and caught on the branch of a tree. The young man seized it,and beheld a pink ribbon.</p><p>"My Faith is gone!" cried he, after one stupefied moment. "There is nogood on earth; and sin is but a name. Come, devil; for to thee is thisworld given."</p><p>And, maddened with despair, so that he laughed loud and long, didGoodman Brown grasp his staff and set forth again, at such a rate thathe seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or run. Theroad grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced, and vanished atlength, leaving him in the heart of the dark wilderness, still rushingonward with the instinct that guides mortal man to evil. The wholeforest was peopled with frightful sounds—the creaking of the trees,the howling of wild beasts, and the yell of Indians; while sometimesthe wind tolled like a distant church bell, and sometimes gave a broadroar around the traveller, as if all Nature were laughing him to scorn.But he was himself the chief horror of the scene, and shrank not fromits other horrors.</p><p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared Goodman Brown when the wind laughed at him.</p><p>"Let us hear which will laugh loudest. Think not to frighten me withyour deviltry. Come witch, come wizard, come Indian powwow, come devilhimself, and here comes Goodman Brown. You may as well fear him as hefear you."</p><p>In truth, all through the haunted forest there could be nothing morefrightful than the figure of Goodman Brown. On he flew among the blackpines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now giving vent toan inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting forth suchlaughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demonsaround him. The fiend in his own shape is less hideous than when herages in the breast of man. Thus sped the demoniac on his course,until, quivering among the trees, he saw a red light before him, aswhen the felled trunks and branches of a clearing have been set onfire, and throw up their lurid blaze against the sky, at the hour ofmidnight. He paused, in a lull of the tempest that had driven himonward, and heard the swell of what seemed a hymn, rolling solemnlyfrom a distance with the weight of many voices. He knew the tune; itwas a familiar one in the choir of the village meeting-house. The versedied heavily away, and was lengthened by a chorus, not of human voices,but of all the sounds of the benighted wilderness pealing in awfulharmony together. Goodman Brown cried out, and his cry was lost to hisown ear by its unison with the cry of the desert.</p><p>In the interval of silence he stole forward until the light glared fullupon his eyes. At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by the darkwall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude, naturalresemblance either to an altar or a pulpit, and surrounded by fourblazing pines, their tops aflame, their stems untouched, like candlesat an evening meeting. The mass of foliage that had overgrown thesummit of the rock was all on fire, blazing high into the night andfitfully illuminating the whole field. Each pendent twig and leafyfestoon was in a blaze. As the red light arose and fell, a numerouscongregation alternately shone forth, then disappeared in shadow, andagain grew, as it were, out of the darkness, peopling the heart of thesolitary woods at once.</p><p>"A grave and dark-clad company," quoth Goodman Brown.</p><p>In truth they were such. Among them, quivering to and fro between gloomand splendor, appeared faces that would be seen next day at the councilboard of the province, and others which, Sabbath after Sabbath, lookeddevoutly heavenward, and benignantly over the crowded pews, from theholiest pulpits in the land. Some affirm that the lady of the governorwas there. At least there were high dames well known to her, and wivesof honored husbands, and widows, a great multitude, and ancientmaidens, all of excellent repute, and fair young girls, who trembledlest their mothers should espy them. Either the sudden gleams of lightflashing over the obscure field bedazzled Goodman Brown, or herecognized a score of the church members of Salem village famous fortheir especial sanctity. Good old Deacon Gookin had arrived, and waitedat the skirts of that venerable saint, his revered pastor. But,irreverently consorting with these grave, reputable, and pious people,these elders of the church, these chaste dames and dewy virgins, therewere men of dissolute lives and women of spotted fame, wretches givenover to all mean and filthy vice, and suspected even of horrid crimes.It was strange to see that the good shrank not from the wicked, norwere the sinners abashed by the saints. Scattered also among theirpale-faced enemies were the Indian priests, or powwows, who had oftenscared their native forest with more hideous incantations than anyknown to English witchcraft.</p><p>"But where is Faith?" thought Goodman Brown; and, as hope came into hisheart, he trembled.</p><p>Another verse of the hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain, such asthe pious love, but joined to words which expressed all that our naturecan conceive of sin, and darkly hinted at far more. Unfathomable tomere mortals is the lore of fiends. Verse after verse was sung; andstill the chorus of the desert swelled between like the deepest tone ofa mighty organ; and with the final peal of that dreadful anthem therecame a sound, as if the roaring wind, the rushing streams, the howlingbeasts, and every other voice of the unconcerted wilderness weremingling and according with the voice of guilty man in homage to theprince of all. The four blazing pines threw up a loftier flame, andobscurely discovered shapes and visages of horror on the smoke wreathsabove the impious assembly. At the same moment the fire on the rockshot redly forth and formed a glowing arch above its base, where nowappeared a figure. With reverence be it spoken, the figure bore noslight similitude, both in garb and manner, to some grave divine of theNew England churches.</p><p>"Bring forth the converts!" cried a voice that echoed through the fieldand rolled into the forest.</p><p>At the word, Goodman Brown stepped forth from the shadow of the treesand approached the congregation, with whom he felt a loathfulbrotherhood by the sympathy of all that was wicked in his heart. Hecould have well-nigh sworn that the shape of his own dead fatherbeckoned him to advance, looking downward from a smoke wreath, while awoman, with dim features of despair, threw out her hand to warn himback. Was it his mother? But he had no power to retreat one step, norto resist, even in thought, when the minister and good old DeaconGookin seized his arms and led him to the blazing rock. Thither camealso the slender form of a veiled female, led between Goody Cloyse,that pious teacher of the catechism, and Martha Carrier, who hadreceived the devil's promise to be queen of hell. A rampant hag wasshe. And there stood the proselytes beneath the canopy of fire.</p><p>"Welcome, my children," said the dark figure, "to the communion of yourrace. Ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny. Mychildren, look behind you!"</p><p>They turned; and flashing forth, as it were, in a sheet of flame, thefiend worshippers were seen; the smile of welcome gleamed darkly onevery visage.</p><p>"There," resumed the sable form, "are all whom ye have reverenced fromyouth. Ye deemed them holier than yourselves, and shrank from your ownsin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and prayerfulaspirations heavenward. Yet here are they all in my worshippingassembly. This night it shall be granted you to know their secretdeeds: how hoary-bearded elders of the church have whispered wantonwords to the young maids of their households; how many a woman, eagerfor widows' weeds, has given her husband a drink at bedtime and let himsleep his last sleep in her bosom; how beardless youths have made hasteto inherit their fathers' wealth; and how fair damsels—blush not,sweet ones—have dug little graves in the garden, and bidden me, thesole guest to an infant's funeral. By the sympathy of your human heartsfor sin ye shall scent out all the places—whether in church,bedchamber, street, field, or forest—where crime has been committed,and shall exult to behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, onemighty blood spot. Far more than this. It shall be yours to penetrate,in every bosom, the deep mystery of sin, the fountain of all wickedarts, and which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than humanpower—than my power at its utmost—can make manifest in deeds. Andnow, my children, look upon each other."</p><p>They did so; and, by the blaze of the hell-kindled torches, thewretched man beheld his Faith, and the wife her husband, tremblingbefore that unhallowed altar.</p><p>"Lo, there ye stand, my children," said the figure, in a deep andsolemn tone, almost sad with its despairing awfulness, as if his onceangelic nature could yet mourn for our miserable race. "Depending uponone another's hearts, ye had still hoped that virtue were not all adream. Now are ye undeceived. Evil is the nature of mankind. Evil mustbe your only happiness. Welcome again, my children, to the communion ofyour race."</p><p>"Welcome," repeated the fiend worshippers, in one cry of despair andtriumph.</p><p>And there they stood, the only pair, as it seemed, who were yethesitating on the verge of wickedness in this dark world. A basin washollowed, naturally, in the rock. Did it contain water, reddened by thelurid light? or was it blood? or, perchance, a liquid flame? Herein didthe shape of evil dip his hand and prepare to lay the mark of baptismupon their foreheads, that they might be partakers of the mystery ofsin, more conscious of the secret guilt of others, both in deed andthought, than they could now be of their own. The husband cast one lookat his pale wife, and Faith at him. What polluted wretches would thenext glance show them to each other, shuddering alike at what theydisclosed and what they saw!</p><p>"Faith! Faith!" cried the husband, "look up to heaven, and resist thewicked one."</p><p>Whether Faith obeyed he knew not. Hardly had he spoken when he foundhimself amid calm night and solitude, listening to a roar of the windwhich died heavily away through the forest. He staggered against therock, and felt it chill and damp; while a hanging twig, that had beenall on fire, besprinkled his cheek with the coldest dew.</p><p>The next morning young Goodman Brown came slowly into the street ofSalem village, staring around him like a bewildered man. The good oldminister was taking a walk along the graveyard to get an appetite forbreakfast and meditate his sermon, and bestowed a blessing, as hepassed, on Goodman Brown. He shrank from the venerable saint as if toavoid an anathema. Old Deacon Gookin was at domestic worship, and theholy words of his prayer were heard through the open window. "What Goddoth the wizard pray to?" quoth Goodman Brown. Goody Cloyse, thatexcellent old Christian, stood in the early sunshine at her ownlattice, catechizing a little girl who had brought her a pint ofmorning's milk. Goodman Brown snatched away the child as from the graspof the fiend himself. Turning the corner by the meeting-house, he spiedthe head of Faith, with the pink ribbons, gazing anxiously forth, andbursting into such joy at sight of him that she skipped along thestreet and almost kissed her husband before the whole village. ButGoodman Brown looked sternly and sadly into her face, and passed onwithout a greeting.</p><p>Had Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest and only dreamed a wilddream of a witch-meeting?</p><p>Be it so if you will; but, alas! it was a dream of evil omen for youngGoodman Brown. A stern, a sad, a darkly meditative, a distrustful, ifnot a desperate man did he become from the night of that fearful dream.On the Sabbath day, when the congregation were singing a holy psalm, hecould not listen because an anthem of sin rushed loudly upon his earand drowned all the blessed strain. When the minister spoke from thepulpit with power and fervid eloquence, and, with his hand on the openBible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and of saint-like livesand triumphant deaths, and of future bliss or misery unutterable, thendid Goodman Brown turn pale, dreading lest the roof should thunder downupon the gray blasphemer and his hearers. Often, waking suddenly atmidnight, he shrank from the bosom of Faith; and at morning oreventide, when the family knelt down at prayer, he scowled and mutteredto himself, and gazed sternly at his wife, and turned away. And when hehad lived long, and was borne to his grave a hoary corpse, followed byFaith, an aged woman, and children and grandchildren, a goodlyprocession, besides neighbors not a few, they carved no hopeful verseupon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom.</p></div>
